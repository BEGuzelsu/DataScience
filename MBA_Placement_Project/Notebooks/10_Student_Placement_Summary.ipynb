    "An organization for higher education has requested that data scientist takes a look at a sample of their student information to for two main purposes:\n",
    "* A model that can predict whether a student will find employment or not based on features provided the organization\n",
    "* Some preliminary work on model that can predict salary to see if a model can be considered for further contract work\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to provide students more information regarding their career trajectory so they can make more informed choices. While the data set we can used is locked (as the organization could only get an initial sign off from so many students to use their information for the model building stage), we are free to explore any model we wish in terms of developing the model.\n",

We are fortunate that the data is relatively clean but does require some data wrangling to get into a state that we can begin to use for our data science project."

    "1. Some categorical features that had only two possible outcomes (such as gender)  needed to be converted to a binary variable that could be used by various models. For example, we converted the \"gender\" feature to a \"female\" feature which is \"0\" if the student is male, and \"1\" if the student is female. This procedure was repeated for other features including (but not limited to) \"ssc_b\", \"hsc_b\", \"status\", and \"workex.\" In addition, feature names were adjusted for readability (e.g., \"workex\" was converted to \"work_experience\"\n",
    "2. For features that were categorical features with more than two possible outcomes (such as \"hsc_c\"), we create binary features to capture the different outcomes while leaving one category out to act as the base category. In the case of \"hsc_c\" which had three possible outcomes (i.e., \"Commerce\", \"Arts\", and \"Science\"), we leave the \"Arts\" category out as that becomes the base category and have binary features for \"Commerce\" and \"Science\"\n",
    "3. For the \"salary\" feature, if the student was unemployed, the salary was listed as \"NaN\" which correlated to a lack of employment. For the purposes of our modeling, the \"NaN\" outcome was replaced with zeroes.\n",
    "4. We checked any features that had an associated range (e.g., \"hsc_p\") to see if there were any outliers we'd need to consider. Outliers were determined using the IQR test of being either less than the 25% percentile value minus 1.5x the IQR or greater than the 75% percentile value plus 1.5 the IQR\n",

    "Since we are working with a binary classification problem with predicting modeling, a good place to start is logistic regression. However, to do this properly, we also need to split our data set into a training set and a testing set. For our modeling, create a testing set that is 25% of the original data set. In addition, using Grid Search, we determine that the \"C\" parameter for our model should be \"1.\" The end result is an accuracy measure of 88.89%\n",

Once we complete training the model, we get an accuracy measure of 81.48%\n",
    "\n",
    "_Gradient Boosting Classifier_\n",
    "\n",
    "One last model to consider is a Gradient Boosting Classifier. Using the same training/testing split as before and using Grid Search, we conclude the optimal hyper parameters are a learning rate of \"1\" and \"n_estimators\" of 54. When we train the model and then test its accuracy, we get an accuracy of 79.63% which is quite low and therefore we won't further consider the Gradient Boosting Classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Precision Consideration_\n",
    "\n",
    "In a situation like this, we need to consider the gravity of False Negatives vs. False Positives. In general, it's probably far worse to have False Positive (predicting someone will get employement when in fact they will not get employment) as opposed to a False Negative (predicting someone will be unemployment but does end up getting a job). As such, the precision of a model will be something to consider as this is an indication of how often a model gets False Positives. For our Random Forest Classifier, find it has a precision score of 82.93% while our Logistic Regression Model has a precision score of 86.05%.\n",

One consideration it does show us is that we could chance our threshold to label an onservation \"Positive\" (meaning predicting employement) to increase our rate of getting True Positives with the tradeoff of getting more False Positives. However, given the context of this problem where a False Positive has more costly connotations than a False Negative, we'll keep our model as is. If we check the Confusion Matrix, we can see that our model avoided all False Negatives but did end up with *some* False Positives. This may mean we can consider whether we are better off having some predictions as False Negatives if it means we can decrease the number of False Positives. Otherwise, the model performed quite well at accurately predicting student employment outcomes. One last thing we can check is the magnitudes of our coefficients to get a sense of how pertient any given input feature was in predicting employment.\n",

    "* Someone's \"ssc_p\", \"hsc_p\", \"degree_p\" (different testing results), and having \"work_experience\" appear to have the highest effect on positively predicting someone will have employment. If these are features that are determine *before* a student enters the institution, it may call into question how effective the institution is at providing value to students in terms of gaining employment. The institution may need to consider how it can support students who come in with \"pre-determined\" features to get them up to speed. As a recommendation, the institution would want to see pre-determined features *decrease* in terms of magnitude while seeing features determined while at the institution *increase*.\n",
    "* Oddly enough, \"mba_p\", has a *negative* magnitude with gaining employement which seems counter-intuitive if the organization is based on business education. That said, it may warrant further investigation regarding the value of getting high marks if employers don't seem to be particularly concerned about it. This may also suggest that activities that take away from studying *but* can contribute to gaining employment (e.g., time spent on informational interviews, networking, internships, etc.) may provide more value in getting employment.
