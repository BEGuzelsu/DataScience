1) Model Type: Recommender System (Prediction of a Variable)

2) Used Parameters:
* Movie ID
* User ID
* Rating (1 to 5 with 1 being "bad" and 5 being "excellent")

3) Hyper-paramter:
* If using a similarity metric: Which type (We use Euclidean & Cosine for this project)

4) Performance Metric
* Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

5) Results (Display the Root Mean Squared Error for each model):
* Naively guessing "3" for each movie: 1.2401
* Unweighted average of ratings by movie: 1.0300
* Weighted average of ratings based on Euclidean similarity: 1.0295 **
* Weighted average of ratings based on Cosine similarity: 1.0355
